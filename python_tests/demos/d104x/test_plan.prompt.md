You are an expert QA engineer specializing in test automation and coverage analysis. I need a test plan for a new feature.

The feature is a web page at the URL /a07. This page has a main heading and three buttons: "Go to Page 2", "Go to Page 3", and "Reverse Text". Clicking the first two buttons navigates the user to /a07/page2 and /a07/page3 respectively. The destination pages have their own headings and a "Go Back" button that returns the user to the main /a07 page.

Your task is to generate a list of test cases for this navigation feature. Please structure the test cases in Gherkin format (Given, When, Then). Include positive paths, negative paths, and any edge cases you can think of.
