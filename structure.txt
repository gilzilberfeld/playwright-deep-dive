Playwright tutorial
	Intro
		History
		Vs Cypress, Selenium
		Why it's cooler
			Timeouts
			No stale elements
	Architecture
		Drivers
	Installation
		npm i playwright --save-dev
		npx playwright init
		Drivers
		Config
			base url  -> should be set
			run server -> should be set
		VS Code extension
	My first test
		Example: goto + locator + click + validate
			Page with title, input box and label that updates based on the input. button is disabled in the beginning.
		Run (headless, no-headless)
		Skip
		Debug
		Exercise
			-> different input
			-> Add check that button is disabled in the beginning
			-> Add check that button is enabled after clicking
			-> check that after clearing the text box button is disabled
			Organize the tests
	Query types
		find, query,get
		Example: goto + textbox + button. Clicking, shows an error, typing cleans the error
		Exercise:
			Write tests that check the error being there or not.
	Locators
		Roles, XPath, selectors, placeholders
		Example (from 1): goto + locator + click + validate
			Show in Dev Tools
			Inspector
		Exercise
			3 boxes (including placeholders ) + button
			Write 1 test in 3/4 different ways
				Roles, Placeholders, XPath
	Assertions
		List
		Exercise I 
			Buttons (clear / all ), check boxes,  
			Buttons operate check boxes, and user can check 
			Write tests that check things operate correctly.
		Exercise II 	
			Buttons (add / remove / clear) + input Text, with options

	Different Browsers
		Example: run with another
	Browser interaction	
		Navigation (back/forward)
		Example Navigation
			Textbox empty
			Button causing navigation with the text to the next page, check url, then going back checks the textbox is empty
		Exercise
			Page1 textbox + button -> Page2 shows text from page 1, textbox , button-> Page3 shows text from both -> back, check that the text is correct -> back check the text text is correct -> forward, text is correct-> forward, title is text
		Browser context

		Frames
			Example
				Page containing frame, get the frame and find the control
			Exercise
				Textboxes and buttons send something to the server, need to refresh the frame, and get the result from the text
	Trace/debug tools
		Debugging
			Example (one of former)
			Pick Locator
		Trace viewer
			Record
			Play
		page.pause
		headed mode
		Screenshots
			Exercise
				Create a screenshot
		Test generation
			Demo on example
				Show changes
			Exercise
				https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/index.php
				Calculate and add assert sum less than...
				Bonus: Improve test
	API tests
		Example
			clear db before...
		Exercise	
			Add something to db
			check that it was added
	Dynamic things
		Dialogs 
			Getting rid of errors
				Example
		Waiting and timeouts
	Grouping
		Before each/all
		describe
		POMs
			Example 
				Translate (Example Navigation)
			Exercise
				From webinar
